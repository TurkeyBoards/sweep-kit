# Turkey Sweep Kit Keyboard
The Sweep is an ultra-minimal, low-profile split ergonomic keyboard that’s all about simplicity, speed, and comfort. With its compact 34-key column-staggered layout with choc spacing, the Sweep encourages efficient typing by reducing finger travel and promoting a natural wrist position. Its lightweight and portable design makes it perfect for travel, minimalist setups, or anyone looking to try a smaller ergonomic keyboard without sacrificing functionality.

When developing our Sweep Kit, we kept the core open-source design but added upgrades for modern builds — including support for both wired and wireless configurations, hot-swap sockets, and tight choc spacing. The result is a tiny but powerful board that’s highly customizable to your typing needs.

Key Features:

- Ultra-compact 34-key split ergonomic layout
- Supports wired & wireless connectivity (based on installed MCU)
- Pro Micro and compatible controller support
- jLow-profile hot-swap Choc v1 switches
